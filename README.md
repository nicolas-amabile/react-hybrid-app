# react-hybrid-app
### Proof of concept for an hybrid reactJS and react-native app sharing the same core logic
### What is this app?
A timer, with a reset button ðŸ˜Œ quite innovative, huh? 
Joking aside, the main porpouse of this project was to prove that is possible to share common logic between web and mobile platforms by using [HOCs](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) and workspaces.

Very interesting reading about how all of this is tight together [here](https://medium.com/viewsdx/how-to-use-yarn-workspaces-with-create-react-app-and-create-react-native-app-expo-to-share-common-ea27bc4bad62).
